# Random_Quote_Generator
 

Random Quote Generator
Overview
For this project, you’ll build a Random Quote Generator using Html, CSS & JavaScript. 
Project Setup
Inside your Dev directory, create a new directory and call it random_quote_generator
cd inside random_quote_generator and create an index.html file.
Either use code. to open up the VS code or you can manually open VS code and choose random_quote_generator to open up.
In index.html, get the boilerplate by pressing (!)- Emmet abbreviation, change the title to random_quote_generator
Create an app.js file and link it to the index.html.
In the app.js file write console.log(“connected!”), open up the index.html in chrome, inspect the page and see if your app.js file is connected!
Make sure you’re indenting your code and use comments whenever necessary. 
Goals
When I click on the button “show another quote” I should be able to get a random quote.
Specifications
For this mini-project, you can either use arrays to store quotes and display them after clicking the “show another quote” button or you can use JavaScript async/await with the fetch API to pull random quotes. 
Be sure to style the page in the way you prefer. It does not need to look exactly like the example. 
Remember you are manipulating DOM elements, so use all you learned this week: Creating elements, getting elements, and creating  “click” events. 
Deploy your code on Github pages or Netlify. 
Send us your GitHub link with the deployed code in the JWD Student Channel.
Resources 
const url="https://type.fit/api/quotes" If you choose to use API, this Url could be useful. 

There are many APIs out there. Github has a large library. Look for quote APIs with no authorization necessary or with an api key. https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists

Bonus 1
If you finish before time is up, then try out this bonus material.
Add an input section (dropdown menu, maybe) to input a famous person’s name.
When you click on the button “Quote Me”, a random quote will show up from that specific person.
					Happy Coding :)
